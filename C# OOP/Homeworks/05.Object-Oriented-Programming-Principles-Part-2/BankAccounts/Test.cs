/* Problem 2. Bank accounts
 * A bank holds different types of accounts for its customers: 
   deposit accounts, loan accounts and mortgage accounts. 
   Customers could be individuals or companies.
 * All accounts have customer, balance and interest rate (monthly based).
    - Deposit accounts are allowed to deposit and with draw money.
    - Loan and mortgage accounts can only deposit money.
 * All accounts can calculate their interest amount for a given period 
   (in months). In the common case its is calculated as follows: 
   number_of_months * interest_rate.
 * Loan accounts have no interest for the first 3 months if are held 
   by individuals and for the first 2 months if are held by a company.
 * Deposit accounts have no interest if their balance 
   is positive and less than 1000.
 * Mortgage accounts have ½ interest for the first 12 months for companies 
   and no interest for the first 6 months for individuals.
 * Your task is to write a program to model the bank system 
   by classes and interfaces.
 * You should identify the classes, interfaces, base classes 
   and abstract actions and implement the calculation 
   of the interest functionality through overridden methods.
